<article>
	<blockquote>I've always thoroughly admired UX Brighton not only for the quality of the speakers, but also for the crowd of UX-ers it attracts. There's something different about this event that reflects the quirky, but intelligent nature of it's founders. You won't have to listen to any management speak as the conference prides itself on attracting people to speak who have always struck the balance between being inspirational and giving practical advice. I always take away a bunch of useful things after each event. To get the most out of this event you should say hello to the person sitting next to you, you won't regret it.</blockquote>

	<p>I am not a UX-geek and can only say that UX Brighton 2011 was one of the best events I participated last year. 
	Sharing knowledge and ideas is always inspiring, but the insights, the conversations and the people I met, had a real impact in my thinking and work over the last few months.</p> 
	<p>In a nutshell: it is like being at the same time in present and future, immersed in a really engaging experience.
	UX Brighton will be in must attend list for the next 10 years!</p></blockquote>

	<blockquote>The very first UX Brighton last September was an incredible event that brought together a LOT of talented people - and I'm not just thinking about those of us fortunate enough to be on the programme. The audience was engaged, informed, and entertaining. Rarely have I had so much fun talking to conference participants and I learned a lot, too. Brighton is a helluva cool town! This could well become one of the top three events in the UK - so get your ticket NOW!</blockquote>

Outside of the interesting subject matter presentations, my key take out (as an MD of a design and innovation consultancy) was the energy that is currently powering Interaction Design forward and the positive approach to both the discipline and the market place. I will be there again this year. Looking forward to it.”</blockquote>
